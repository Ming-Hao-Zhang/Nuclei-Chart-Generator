# nuclei-chart

This is a very simple, beginner-friendly Python program that helps you automatically generate a nuclei chart.

This program is designed to be easy for beginners to use. Follow these steps to get started:

Download and install the latest version of Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/.

After installation, the most convenient way to run the program is by using Spyder to execute the .py file.

Data Updates

The data.txt file contains information on known nuclei as of June 16, 2024. To update this information, visit the following websites:

Data File Explanation

The first and second lines represent the charge and proton number of the nucleus, respectively.
Lines 3 to 10 indicate the synthesis methods for Mass Spectroscopy, Radioactive Decay, Light Particles, Fission, Fusion, Spallation, Projectile Fragmentation, and Transfer/Deep Inelastic Scattering. A value of 1 indicates that the nucleus can be synthesized using that method, while a value of 0 means the method is ignored.

Notes

The arialuni font is included in the program, but it is not necessary. I just haven't removed it from the code.

This is rough code I wrote in early 2021 when I was learning Python. There are many silly parts in the codeã€‚ Even though the data has been verified many times, its reliability cannot be guaranteed 100%, so please use it only as a reference. I hope this can help you.
